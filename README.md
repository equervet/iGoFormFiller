This extension allows you to fill iGo input fields (textboxes, textareas, radio buttons, dropdowns, etc.) with dummy data. It is a must for developers and testers who work with forms as it avoids the need for manually entering values in fields. Some options are specific to iGo to generate the most accurate data.
